  First, to introduce you to core database concepts (e.g., data modeling, logical design, SQL) 
  so that you too can build a billion dollar application.
  Second, to teach enough about database engine internals (e.g., physical database design, query optimization, transaction processing) so you have a good sense of why queries
  may be running slowly/incorrectly.
  **Students are expected to be comfortable with data structures and Python.**
