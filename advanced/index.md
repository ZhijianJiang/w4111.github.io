## Advanced Assignments

The series of advanced assignments will ask you to write programs or edit a simple database to turn the concepts discussed in class into actual code.  Some of these will be self-contained assignments, and some will add new features or improvements into a simple Python-based query engine called  [DataBass](https://www.github.com/w4111/databass).
